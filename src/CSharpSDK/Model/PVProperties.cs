Standard test conditions are 1,000 Watts per square meter solar irradiance, 25 degrees C cell temperature, and ASTM G173-03 standard spectrum. Nameplate efficiencies reported by manufacturers are typically under STC. Standard poly- or mono-crystalline silicon modules tend to have rated efficiencies in the range of 14-17%. Premium high efficiency mono-crystalline silicon modules with anti-reflective coatings can have efficiencies in the range of 18-20%. Thin film photovoltaic modules typically have efficiencies of 11% or less. (Default: 0.15 for standard silicon solar cells).</param>

PV module) area and the active cells within the panel as well as any losses for how the (typically rectangular) panels can be arranged on the Shade geometry. When the parent Shade geometry represents just the solar panels, this fraction is typically around 0.9 given that the framing elements of the panel reduce the overall active area.

When the rated_efficiency is between 12-18%, the Standard type is typically most appropriate. When the rated_efficiency is greater than 18%, the Premium type is likely more appropriate. When the rated_efficiency is less than 12%, this likely refers to a case where the ThinFilm module type is most appropriate.</param>

Note that the OneAxis options have an axis of rotation that is determined by the azimuth of the parent Shade geometry. Also note that, in the case of one or two axis tracking, shadows on the (static) parent Shade geometry still reduce the electrical output, enabling the simulation to account for large context geometry casting shadows on the array. However, the effects of smaller detailed shading may be improperly accounted for and self shading of the dynamic panel geometry is only accounted for via the tracking_ground_coverage_ratio property on this object. FixedOpenRack refers to ground or roof mounting where the air flows freely. FixedRoofMounted refers to mounting flush with the roof with limited air flow. OneAxis refers to a fixed tilt and azimuth, which define an axis of rotation. OneAxisBacktracking is the same as OneAxis but with controls to reduce self-shade at low sun angles.
