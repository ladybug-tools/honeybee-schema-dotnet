This is often a function of the fan speed and the conditions in which the fan is operating since having the fan blow air through filters or narrow ducts will increase the pressure rise that is needed to deliver the input flow rate. The pressure rise plays an important role in determining the amount of energy consumed by the fan. Smaller fans like a 0.05 m3/s desk fan tend to have lower pressure rises around 60 Pa. Larger fans, such as a 6 m3/s fan used for ventilating a large room tend to have higher pressure rises around 400 Pa.
