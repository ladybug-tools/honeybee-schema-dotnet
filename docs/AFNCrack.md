## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Type** | **string** |  | [optional] [readonly] [default to "AFNCrack"]
**FlowCoefficient** | **double** | A number in kg/s-m at 1 Pa per meter of crack length at the conditions defined in the ReferenceCrack condition; required to run an AirflowNetwork simulation. The DesignBuilder Cracks template defines the flow coefficient for a tight, low-leakage wall to be 0.00001 and 0.001 for external and internal constructions, respectively. Flow coefficients for a very poor, high-leakage wall are defined to be 0.0004 and 0.019 for external and internal constructions, respectively. | 
**FlowExponent** | **double** | An optional dimensionless number between 0.5 and 1 used to calculate the crack mass flow rate; required to run an AirflowNetwork simulation. This value represents the leak geometry impact on airflow, with 0.5 generally corresponding to turbulent orifice flow and 1 generally corresponding to laminar flow. The default of 0.65 is representative of many cases of wall and window leakage, used when the exponent cannot be measured. | [optional] [default to 0.65D]
