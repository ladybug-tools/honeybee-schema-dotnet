Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Code** | **string** | Text with 6 digits for the error code. The first two digits indicate whether the error is a core honeybee error (00) vs. an extension error (any non-zero number). The second two digits indicate the nature of the error (00 is an identifier error, 01 is a geometry error, 02 is an adjacency error). The third two digits are used to give a unique ID to each condition moving upwards from more specific/detailed objects/errors to coarser/more abstract objects/errors. |
